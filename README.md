- 👋 Hi, I’m Argle
- 👀 I’m interested in Music, Movies and arts and crafts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte 5
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - a Svelte component library for Svelte 5. Features:
    - Full collection of components that match Windows/Max/Linux objects
    - No reliance on outside components (like Tailwind)
    - Typescripted
    - ARIA compliance
    - Responsive (duh)
  - a software tool to do keyboard chording
    - Using AutoHotkey
    - AHK scripting language 2
    - On the fly learning
